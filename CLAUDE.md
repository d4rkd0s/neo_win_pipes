# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (or any AI assistant) working in this repository.

## What this project is

A cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux) recreation of the classic Windows
"3D Pipes" screensaver, in Rust. End goal: a genuinely installable,
OS-selectable screensaver package on all three platforms — not just a
fullscreen demo app. Full context: `docs/RESEARCH.md` (what the original
did and why), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (how this codebase is structured),
`docs/ROADMAP.md` (what phase we're in).

**Current phase**: Phase 4. Windows is fully there:
`neo_win_pipes.msi` (`installer/main.wxs`, built with WiX v7) is a real,
double-click installer: `pipes-app.exe` → `System32\neo_win_pipes.scr`,
`pipes-settings.exe` → Program Files + Start Menu shortcuts (including
uninstall). `pipes-settings::update` checks GitHub Releases in the
background and offers a one-click update. On top of Phase 3's `.scr`
contract (`/s`/`/c`/`/p <hwnd>` — see `screensaver_args.rs`/`winsaver.rs`)
and Phase 2.5's `pipes-render` + `pipes-settings`.

**Linux is verified on real hardware.** `pipes-xscreensaver` renders
(real X11 window/display resolution via `x11-dl`, reusing
`pipes-render::Renderer` through a raw-window-handle bridge — see
`x11_target.rs`), and `installer/linux/` builds a real `.deb` (the hack +
`pipes-settings`, installed via `xscreensaver`'s own config-XML
convention) plus a `pipes-settings`-only AppImage. Beyond compiling and
passing clippy on `ubuntu-latest` CI, this has now actually been watched
rendering on a real machine (NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti, wgpu Vulkan backend):
into a bare X server's root window, and into the window a live
`xscreensaver` 6.08 daemon hands it. That second case needed a real fix —
the daemon passes no CLI args at all, only the `XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW`
env var (`args::resolve_target_window` now reads both, argv taking
precedence — see `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the full writeup). Still no macOS
verification story, and no one's yet confirmed the packages install
cleanly from a stock desktop's package manager end to end, but the
core "does it render" question — this project's previous single
biggest open assumption on Linux — is closed.

**macOS is still design-only** — no code at all, no `.saver` bundle, not
even argument parsing, because there's no way to compile Objective-C/Swift
or link a Mach-O binary from this project's Windows dev machine at all
(unlike Linux, which at least cross-compiles/type-checks here). See
`docs/ROADMAP.md` before claiming otherwise about either platform.

## Commands

```sh
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace               # must pass before any change is done — 132 tests as of this writing (Phase 4, Windows + Linux)
cargo run -p pipes-app -- --seed 1  # the screensaver, dev mode (behaves like /s)
cargo run -p pipes-app -- /s        # exercise the real Windows contract directly
cargo run -p pipes-app -- /c        # launches pipes-settings, exits
cargo run -p pipes-settings         # live preview + settings drawer + update checker
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -p pipes-app -- --seed 1
```

Cutting a release: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z` — see
`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#cutting-a-release`. Don't hand-edit
`Cargo.toml`'s `[workspace.package]` version for a release; the release
workflow derives it from the tag.

Building the `.msi` needs WiX v7 (a per-user `dotnet` tool, plus a
one-time EULA acceptance — see
`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#building-the-windows-installer-msi`). **Never accept
a tool's EULA/licensing terms on the user's behalf without asking first**
— this came up for real with WiX v7's Open Source Maintenance Fee terms;
free for this project, but still a legal acceptance to check with the
user about, not something to click through silently.

If linking fails on Windows-on-ARM64, see the caveat in
`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` before assuming the code is broken — it's a known
local-toolchain issue, not a bug in this repo.

## Empirical Verification Contract

**Never assert a visual, rendering, or runtime behavior from reading
source code alone — always execute and observe.** This isn't a style
preference: this project has repeatedly shipped real bugs that reading
the code never would have caught — a hidden 3D preview behind egui's
opaque default panel, `/s` exiting within milliseconds of its own
synthetic startup events, a wgpu device-loss panic, a torus joint with a
visible seam at the exact ratio that looked fine on paper, an update
toast whose click handler silently did nothing because the toast object
was dropped. All of these compiled cleanly and passed `cargo test`. Every
one was only found by actually launching the app, taking a screenshot,
or deliberately triggering the failure condition — see `docs/ROADMAP.md`
for the specifics.

`scripts/verify.sh` operationalizes this as a repeatable check:

```sh
./scripts/verify.sh                          # builds, tests, launches pipes-settings, screenshots it
./scripts/verify.sh --target pipes-app       # same, but the fullscreen screensaver
./scripts/verify.sh --simulate-device-loss   # also forces a real GPU device loss mid-run and
                                              # confirms Renderer::recover_if_needed actually recovers
```

It builds the workspace, runs the full test suite, launches a real
binary, waits for it to render real frames, and captures a screenshot via
`scripts/capture_window.ps1` (a `PrintWindow`-based capture that works
even when the window isn't focused/visible — needed for background/CI
runs). It exits non-zero on any build/test/launch/capture failure, or if
the app log contains an unhandled panic.

**Artifacts land in `artifacts/verify/`**, timestamped per run:
`<stamp>-run.log` (the full verify transcript), `<stamp>-<target>.log`
(the launched app's own log output), and `<stamp>-<target>.png` (the
screenshot) — plus a `-post-recovery.png` when `--simulate-device-loss`
is used. **Actually open the screenshot and look at it** — a non-empty
PNG file existing is not the same as the render being correct.

Passing `verify.sh` is necessary, not sufficient: it proves the app
builds, launches, and renders *something* without crashing. It does not
by itself prove a specific feature (a particular joint type, a specific
settings-drawer control, multi-monitor behavior) is correct — for that,
actually drive the app into the relevant state and inspect the result,
the same way this file's examples above were originally found.

## Non-negotiable conventions for this repo

These were established explicitly at project start and apply to every
change, not just the initial scaffold:

1. **Every change to simulation logic (`pipes-core`) ships with tests in
   the same commit.** Not a follow-up, not "add tests later." This is the
   project's founding requirement — see `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#testing-philosophy`.
2. **`pipes-core` stays free of rendering/windowing dependencies**, and
   `pipes-render` stays free of `pipes-app`/`pipes-settings`-specific
   window/event-loop code. If something can only be verified by looking at
   a window, it belongs in one of the two binary crates, not `pipes-core`
   or `pipes-render`. This is what keeps the simulation testable headlessly
   in CI and keeps the two apps from duplicating rendering/config code.
3. **Determinism is load-bearing, not incidental.** `Scene`/`Pipe` take an
   explicit seeded RNG; never reach for thread-local/OS randomness inside
   `pipes-core`. If you touch RNG call order, expect the
   `same_seed_produces_identical_*` tests to need updating — treat that as
   a real behavior change to review, not noise to silence.
4. **New logged events get a row in `docs/LOGGING.md` in the same
   change.** Logging here is a human-readable design surface (see that
   doc's rationale), not an afterthought.
5. **Keep `docs/ROADMAP.md` checkboxes truthful.** If you ship part of a
   phase, check it off there in the same change.
6. Prefer property-based test assertions ("never re-enters an occupied
   cell") over one golden output value, except where reproducibility
   itself is the property under test.
7. **Never ship unverifiable platform-specific code as if it were
   tested.** If you can't compile or run something on the machine you're
   working on (e.g. macOS/Linux-specific FFI from a Windows box), split
   the work: write and test the OS-independent pure-logic part for real
   (argument parsing, etc. — see `pipes-xscreensaver::args`), and
   document the untestable native part as an explicit plan/TODO rather
   than guessed code. Say so plainly rather than implying it's done.
8. **Actually run what you build before calling it done.** Two real bugs
   in this repo were only caught by launching the app and looking/testing
   directly, not by reading the code: `egui::CentralPanel`'s opaque
   default background hiding the 3D preview, and `/s` mode exiting within
   milliseconds because window creation itself fires a synthetic
   `CursorMoved`. Compiling and passing `cargo test` is necessary, not
   sufficient, for anything involving a window, an event loop, or Win32.
9. **Check whether `site/` (the neowinpipes.com splash page) needs
   updating** whenever a change is genuinely user-facing — a new feature,
   a platform going from unverified to confirmed-working, a new install
   method. It's a hand-maintained static site, not generated from these
   docs or the wiki, so nothing keeps it in sync automatically. Use
   judgment (an internal refactor doesn't need this); the point is to
   check, not to update it reflexively for everything.
10. **Update the relevant `docs/*.md` files and the GitHub wiki in the
    same change as any genuinely user-facing or architecture-affecting
    change** — a new feature, a changed default, a new security-relevant
    behavior, a platform status change. Not "consider whether to" like
    the `site/` guidance above (that one bites for cosmetic/marketing
    content where judgment genuinely varies) — this one is a
    requirement, the same weight as the other non-negotiable items on
    this list, because nothing else keeps `docs/`, the wiki (cloned from
    `https://github.com/brando5393/neo_win_pipes.wiki.git`, not part of
    this repo's own git history), and reality in sync automatically. A
    change that's purely internal (a refactor with no behavior change,
    a test-only commit) doesn't need this; if in doubt, treat it as
    user-facing. This was written down explicitly after a session where
    several real features shipped (the color-palette hex/RGB input, the
    installer artwork fix, the update-notification/checksum work,
    `SECURITY.md`) before the wiki and some `docs/` pages had been
    touched at all — catching up after the fact instead of doing it in
    the same change it belonged in.

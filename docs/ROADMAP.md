# Roadmap

Phased so that every phase leaves the repo in a state with passing tests,
current docs, and working (if limited) software — never a half-wired
feature branch.

## Phase 1 — Simulation core (in progress)

- [x] `pipes-core`: grid, direction, pipe growth/turning/termination,
      scene lifecycle, seeded determinism.
- [x] Unit test suite for all of the above (22 tests as of this writing).
- [x] `pipes-app`: originally a headless CLI runner with human-readable
      `tracing` logs — superseded by the Phase 2 windowed renderer below.
- [x] Repo scaffold: `CLAUDE.md`, docs set, MIT license, `.gitignore`.
- [x] CI (GitHub Actions): build + test + fmt + clippy on `windows-latest`,
      `macos-latest`, `ubuntu-latest` for every push/PR. First real run
      passed on all three (`windows-latest` 4m30s, `macos-latest` 1m29s,
      `ubuntu-latest` 2m6s) — including confirming the Linux dev-library
      install step (`libx11-dev`/`libxkbcommon-dev`/etc., added blind since
      there's no local Linux machine) was actually sufficient for
      `winit`/`wgpu` to compile there.

## Phase 2 — Rendering

- [x] `pipes-app` grows a `winit` window + `wgpu` renderer (later factored
      out into the shared `pipes-render` crate — see Phase 2.5).
- [x] Geometry generation: `pipes-render::geometry` turns segments/joints
      into cylinder / cuboid / sphere meshes (pure functions, unit-tested
      on vertex/index counts, normal validity, and radius bounds — no GPU
      needed to verify shape correctness).
- [x] Instancing: `pipes-render::instance` converts a live `Scene` into
      per-mesh GPU instance buffers (round segments, square segments,
      joints/caps), unit-tested for degenerate-direction NaN safety.
- [x] Slowly drifting orbit camera around the scene.
- [x] Manual visual verification: confirmed rendering live —
      [`docs/screenshots/phase2-first-render-seed3.png`](screenshots/phase2-first-render-seed3.png).
- [x] True chrome material: pipes now get a real environment reflection
      (`sample_environment` in `shader.wgsl` — a procedural analytic sky
      gradient sampled by the reflection vector, not a texture/cubemap
      asset) instead of only Lambertian diffuse + a Blinn-Phong specular
      dot. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#pipes-render` for why a hand-rolled
      gradient rather than a real cubemap. Confirmed live —
      [`docs/screenshots/phase2-chrome-material.png`](screenshots/phase2-chrome-material.png).
- [x] **Elbow joints — shipped as a real smooth torus bend, not a sphere.**
      `geometry::elbow` builds a canonical quarter-torus (fixed tube-ratio
      0.33 of its major radius — a shape constant, not user-tunable, so
      the mesh can upload once at startup like `sphere`/`teapot` instead
      of rebuilding whenever `PipeVisuals` changes); `instance.rs` rotates
      its canonical +Z/-X tangent directions onto each joint's actual
      incoming/outgoing pipe directions via a basis-change quaternion
      (third axis of each frame from a cross product, so the result is
      always a proper rotation, never a mirror). `PipeVisuals::elbow_joint_scale`
      default raised from 1.05 to 3.0 — the old value gave a sphere just
      barely bigger than the pipe radius, which for a torus's *major*
      radius produced almost no visible bend (verified by rendering it
      before tuning: it read as a fat blob nearly indistinguishable from
      a ball joint). Caught one real bug the same way: a pipe's very
      first step can itself count as a "turn" against its spawn's initial
      phantom direction, recording a joint at path index 0 with no real
      predecessor to bend from — `path[index - 1]` panicked with "attempt
      to subtract with overflow" the moment this was actually run, not
      predicted by reading the code. Fixed with an index-0 fallback to
      the same sphere `Ball` joints use, and a regression test that
      forces this exact case via `Pipe::step` with a seeded RNG.
      **Two more real visual bugs, both reported against actual
      screenshots (not caught by any geometry test — the round tube alone
      is perfectly well-formed either way):**
      1. The torus's two open tube ends were left uncapped (fine for the
         teapot handle, which embeds them in the body — see
         `torus_arc`'s doc comment — but an elbow's ends are its *only*
         connection to the pipe) and read as a hollow, curled-open shell.
         Fixed by adding a `disk_cap` fan at each end in `geometry::elbow`,
         built from the exact same `(out, Y)` basis and `phi`
         parametrization `torus_arc` uses for its ring vertices, so the
         cap's rim lines up with the tube's last ring exactly rather than
         approximating it.
      2. `geometry::elbow` is a round tube — butting it against a
         flat-faced *square* pipe segment left a visible step/notch at
         the seam. Fixed in `instance.rs` by restricting the torus to
         `PipeStyle::Round`; `Square` elbows fall back to the same sphere
         `Ball` joints use (matching pre-torus behavior, which never
         looked mismatched since a sphere is a plausible fudge for either
         cross-section). Has its own regression test alongside the
         index-0 one above.
      Both fixes verified by actually re-rendering a live scene and
      screenshotting round-pipe elbows (smooth, no curl) and square-pipe
      elbows (clean sphere, no notch) side by side.
      **One more fillet-quality pass after that**, again by actually
      rendering and zooming into real corners rather than guessing at
      numbers: `minor_segments` raised from 10 to 16 to match
      `cylinder`'s own 16-sided cross-section — the tube was measurably
      more faceted than the straight pipe it connects to, visible as a
      rounder-to-flatter mismatch right at the seam; `major_segments`
      raised 16 → 20 for a smoother bend curve. Separately, a real thin
      seam/notch turned up exactly at the join on close inspection:
      `tube_ratio(0.33) * elbow_joint_scale(3.0)` came to 0.99, meaning
      the tube's radius fell *just under* the straight segment's own
      radius rather than matching or exceeding it. Fixed by raising
      `tube_ratio` to 0.35 (product 1.05) — the same small-overshoot
      principle `ball_joint_scale`/`cap_scale` already use on the sphere
      joints, for the same reason.
      **A real, more serious bug shipped in that same 3.0 value and went
      unnoticed for a while**: two turns can be as little as 1 grid unit
      apart (a turn immediately followed by another), and each elbow
      torus reaches `elbow_joint_scale * pipe_radius` from its own joint
      — at 3.0 that's 0.54 grid units, *more than half* the minimum
      possible spacing, so two adjacent elbows could physically overlap
      and self-intersect. Visually this showed up as small, thin sliver/
      flap artifacts poking out near elbow joints — easy to mistake for
      the teapot easter egg or an overlapping *different* pipe at a
      glance, and only conclusively distinguished by rendering an
      isolated single-pipe, all-elbow scene (`max_pipes: 1`,
      `elbow_probability: 1.0`) where no other pipe could possibly be
      responsible, and the artifact was still there at multiple joints.
      Fixed by lowering `elbow_joint_scale` to 2.5 (0.45 grid units, a
      real margin under the 0.5 limit) and re-solving `tube_ratio` to
      0.42 to keep the seam-matching product at 1.05. Has a regression
      test (`elbow_joint_scale_cannot_reach_past_half_a_grid_unit`)
      asserting this relationship directly, so a future tuning pass can't
      reintroduce it by only checking a couple of spot-checked corners
      the way this one did.
- [x] **GPU device-loss crash — fixed and verified.** Hit for real testing
      `pipes-settings` on a Windows-on-ARM64 machine (Qualcomm Adreno
      X1-85, Vulkan backend): after ~12 minutes and several scene resets,
      `wgpu` panicked with "Error in Surface::get_current_texture_view:
      Validation Error — Caused by: Parent device is lost"
      (`wgpu_core.rs:767`). Likely triggered by a driver reset/TDR, a
      screen lock/sleep, or a flaky Vulkan ICD on that integrated GPU —
      not caused by any app-level change. This bypassed `main.rs`'s
      ordinary `wgpu::SurfaceError` handling entirely: a genuinely lost
      `Device` makes wgpu's own internal error-reporting panic directly
      rather than returning a catchable `Result`.
      `Renderer::set_device_lost_callback` alone (the "official" wgpu API
      for this) turned out *not* to be reliable enough on its own — it
      can fire asynchronously relative to whatever frame actually hits
      the dead device, confirmed by deliberately calling
      `Device::destroy()` mid-run and watching it still panic before the
      callback's own log line appeared. The actual, verified fix:
      `Renderer::draw_frame`/`resize` (`crates/pipes-render/src/renderer.rs`)
      wrap the calls that can panic in `std::panic::catch_unwind`,
      marking the device permanently lost the moment *either* the
      callback fires *or* a panic is caught — whichever happens first —
      and every caller (`pipes-app`, `pipes-settings`,
      `pipes-xscreensaver`) checks `is_device_lost()` before ever calling
      `render`/`resize` again. The existing fatal-error panic hook is
      told to suppress its dialog specifically for a panic caught this
      way (`diagnostics::run_suppressing_fatal_dialog`) — still logged,
      just not interrupting the user with a dialog for something already
      being recovered from. **Verified by actually reproducing the
      crash**: `Device::destroy()` called mid-run against a real build
      (not a hypothetical), confirming the process survives, the window
      stays intact showing its last good frame, no fatal dialog appears,
      and the log shows the graceful path taken exactly once (not once
      per frame).
- [x] **True GPU hot recovery — shipped and verified**, on top of the
      freeze-on-last-frame fix above. `Renderer::try_recover`
      (`crates/pipes-render/src/renderer.rs`) rebuilds the wgpu
      `Instance`/`Adapter`/`Device`/`Queue`/`Surface` and everything built
      from them (pipeline, camera buffer/bind group, the shared meshes)
      from scratch, reusing the `Renderer`'s original window — kept around
      as `Arc<dyn RenderTarget>` (a small object-safe trait bundling the
      raw-window-handle traits) specifically so a second `Surface` could
      be created for it later, which nothing needed before hot recovery
      existed. `Renderer::recover_if_needed()` is what
      `pipes-app`/`pipes-settings`/`pipes-xscreensaver` actually call each
      frame in place of the old plain `is_device_lost()` check: attempts
      recovery once per loss episode, then either resumes rendering or
      falls back to the freeze behavior if recovery itself fails.
      Two real bugs found only by actually triggering a loss (a temporary
      `PIPES_SIMULATE_DEVICE_LOSS=<frame>` env var hook that called
      `Device::destroy()` mid-run, removed once verified) rather than by
      reasoning about the code:
      1. Building the replacement `Surface` for the same window *while
         the old (dead-device) `Surface` was still alive* silently killed
         the whole process with no panic message at all — not the
         "missing COPY_DST flag" validation error you'd expect from a
         stale resource, a hard, silent exit. Fixed by making
         `Renderer::gpu` an `Option<GpuState>`, explicitly dropped
         (`self.gpu = None`) before the new one is built.
      2. `pipes-settings` layers its own `egui_wgpu::Renderer` on the same
         device (for the settings drawer UI) — recovering `Renderer`
         alone left it pointing at the destroyed device, which surfaced
         as "Destination buffer/texture is missing the `COPY_DST` usage
         flag" every frame (a real, if confusing, second failure mode,
         not the same crash recurring). Fixing that exposed a third,
         subtler issue: recreating just `egui_wgpu::Renderer` left
         `egui::Context` still believing the font atlas had already been
         delivered (it had, to the now-gone renderer), so it never
         re-included it in a future texture delta — `set_fonts()` turned
         out to be a no-op here since it only re-uploads when the font
         *definitions* changed, not when the receiving renderer changed.
         Fixed by recreating `egui::Context`/`egui_winit::State` too:
         a fresh `Context`'s first `run()` unconditionally allocates the
         atlas from scratch, sidestepping the stale-cache question
         entirely. Costs only that moment's transient UI state (which
         section was expanded, etc.), not `AppConfig`.
      Verified end-to-end in both `pipes-app` (screenshotted live pipes
      rendering, unaffected by the fixes above since it has no egui layer)
      and `pipes-settings` (screenshotted the 3D preview *and* the egui
      drawer — text, buttons, icons — all correctly rendering again after
      a real, deliberately triggered device loss).
      **A second, distinct recovery bug shipped in that same v0.7.0**,
      reported by a real user hitting a blank white window at random —
      caught from that user's own real crash log (`data/logs/pipes-
      settings.log.<date>`, see `docs/LOGGING.md`), not a live repro:
      `try_recover`'s `self.gpu = None` drops the old, already-lost
      `GpuState` — including its `wgpu::Device` — completely outside any
      `catch_unwind`, unlike `draw_frame`/`resize`. On a genuine hardware/
      driver device loss (not the synthetic `Device::destroy()` used to
      verify this path), wgpu's own `Device::drop` validates against the
      device and panics ("Error in Device::drop: Validation Error —
      Caused by: Parent device is lost") — and since nothing caught it,
      `self.gpu` was left `None` forever (recovery never reaching its
      `Ok` branch) with no further attempt possible: the process and
      window survived, but nothing ever rendered into it again, leaving
      exactly the blank white window the report described. Fixed by
      `.take()`-ing the old `GpuState` out first (so `self.gpu` is
      correctly `None` no matter what happens next) and wrapping the
      actual `drop()` of it in the same `catch_unwind` pattern already
      used elsewhere. **Honestly flagged**: two different attempts to
      force this exact panic in this project's own dev environment (a
      synthetic `Device::destroy()`, with and without an added settle
      delay / an explicit `poll(Maintain::Wait)` first) both failed to
      reproduce it — this specific panic appears to need the internal
      state a genuine driver-level device loss leaves behind, which
      software-only simulation here can't recreate. The fix is applied
      and doesn't regress the existing (still-passing) device-loss
      verification, but wasn't confirmed against the exact failure via a
      live repro the way the rest of this item was — worth a real user
      re-confirming against an actual recurrence.
- [x] **In-app performance benchmark — shipped and verified.** Pipes
      Settings' "Performance" section (`crates/pipes-settings/src/benchmark.rs`)
      runs the *live* renderer through three progressively heavier preset
      scenes (Light = shipped defaults, Medium, Heavy — a 64³ grid at 150
      pipes) and measures real per-frame wall-clock time on the user's own
      GPU, unlike the dev-only Criterion benches in `pipes-core`/
      `pipes-render` (`cargo bench`, see `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`), which
      never touch a `Renderer` at all. Reports export as plain text or a
      branded PDF (via `printpdf`, a pure-Rust generator — no external
      binary/renderer dependency), both usable as a bug-report attachment
      or a "can my machine run this well?" answer — see
      `docs/USAGE.md#system-requirements`.
      Two real bugs found only by actually running it, not by reasoning
      about the numbers:
      1. The very first rendered frame after a `Renderer` is created pays
         a one-off GPU pipeline/shader warm-up cost (~77ms, vs. ~2-7ms
         steady-state) that has nothing to do with a scene's actual
         complexity, and it landed entirely inside the first benchmark
         stage's average, skewing it. Fixed with a small fixed warm-up
         (15 frames, discarded, not counted) before the first sample.
      2. A fixed number of rendered *frames* per stage is not the same
         thing as a fixed number of simulation *ticks* — tick rate is
         decoupled from frame rate (`tick_interval_ms`) — so the "Heavy"
         stage's `Scene` had barely started growing by the time its 180
         frames were up, and the benchmark ended up measuring an
         almost-empty scene. Confirmed by the actual result: "Heavy"
         reported a *higher* FPS than "Light", the opposite of what a
         real stress test should show. Fixed by stepping each stage's
         `Scene` forward 400 ticks (matching `cargo bench -p
         pipes-render`'s own warmup) before measuring any frames —
         cheap, since a tick costs single-digit microseconds even at this
         scale. After both fixes, results came out monotonic and
         believable: ~350 FPS (Light) → ~257 FPS (Medium) → ~158 FPS
         (Heavy) on this project's own dev GPU.
- [x] Checked-in reference screenshots in `docs/screenshots/` (add more as
      the renderer evolves for visual regression comparison).
- [x] Dissolve-on-reset: pipes shrink away over `dissolve_duration_ticks`
      before the scene clears, echoing the original's transition, instead
      of vanishing instantly — toggleable (`dissolve_on_reset`, default
      on). Purely a render-time effect (`pipes-render::instance` scales
      geometry by `Scene::dissolve_progress()`); `pipes-core` only tracks
      a countdown and freezes growth during it. Verified two ways: unit
      tests proving the shrink math (radius scales exactly
      1.0→0.5→0.0 proportionally) and a live run's logs showing several
      clean dissolve→reset cycles at the configured duration (a Windows
      Hello lock screen interrupted the visual/screenshot check —
      unrelated to the app, and the other two verifications were judged
      sufficient rather than fighting the lock screen).
- [x] Found and fixed a real forward-compatibility bug while building
      this: `SimConfig`/`PipeVisuals`/`CameraConfig`/`AppConfig` didn't
      have container-level `#[serde(default)]`, so a config file saved
      before any of these two new fields existed would fail to parse
      *entirely* and silently discard every other setting in it, not just
      fall back for the fields that were actually missing. Fixed on all
      four types; regression-tested with a fixture file missing the new
      fields but customizing others, confirming the others survive.
- [x] Teapot easter egg: a rare, separate roll (`JointKind::Teapot`,
      `SimConfig::teapot_easter_egg_enabled` + `teapot_probability`,
      checked before the elbow/ball roll) renders a procedural teapot
      mesh (`pipes_render::geometry::teapot()` — lathed body/spout,
      torus-arc handle, sphere knob) at a joint instead of the normal
      ball/elbow. Not the exact historical Utah teapot control-point
      dataset (not available to copy correctly) — an honest procedural
      approximation. Two real bugs only caught by actually rendering it
      and looking (unit tests checked well-formedness and vertex
      distance-from-origin, neither of which catches these):
      (1) `lathe()`'s triangle winding turned out backwards relative to
      the mesh's own vertex normals, which — combined with backface
      culling — silently discarded most of the body/spout, leaving only
      a stray sliver of the (correctly-wound) handle visible. Fixed by
      disabling backface culling in the shared pipeline entirely rather
      than hand-deriving winding per mesh: lighting here uses each
      vertex's authored normal directly, not a winding-derived face
      normal, so culling buys negligible fill-rate savings at this
      scene's tiny polygon counts against a real, easy-to-reintroduce
      failure mode. (2) Even after that, the first spout profile was a
      full 1.0-unit-long cone translated out past the body's own 0.5
      radius, so the whole mesh's bounding box was ~2 units wide against
      ~1.1 tall — a long flat bar, not a teapot. Fixed by shortening the
      spout and moving its base back to the body's actual surface;
      added a bounding-box aspect-ratio regression test
      (`teapot_is_well_formed_and_roughly_teapot_sized`) since the
      existing per-vertex distance check didn't catch it.

## Phase 2.5 — Settings app (shipped)

- [x] Extracted `geometry`/`instance`/`renderer` out of `pipes-app` into a
      shared `pipes-render` library crate, with `AppConfig` (persisted as
      TOML in the OS's standard per-user config dir) added alongside them.
- [x] `AppConfig::sanitize()` clamps every field to a safe range on load
      (unit-tested: missing file, corrupt file, save/load round-trip,
      out-of-range clamping) so a hand-edited config can't break the app.
- [x] `pipes-settings`: a standalone window — live 3D preview on the left
      (rendered into a sub-viewport via `Renderer::render_with`), an egui
      settings drawer on the right. Covers all four validated categories
      from `docs/FEATURE_IDEAS.md`: pipe style & count, speed & camera,
      color palette (presets + custom per-color editing), grid size &
      reset threshold. Autosaves on every change; "Reset to defaults"
      button. `pipes-app` (the actual screensaver) reads the same file.
- [x] Manual visual verification: launched, screenshotted, confirmed the
      live preview actually updates and isn't hidden behind egui's default
      opaque panel background (a real bug hit and fixed during
      development — `CentralPanel` needs `Frame::none()` when something
      else is drawing underneath it in the same frame).
- [x] Wired up as the Windows `.scr`'s `/c` handler (Phase 3): `pipes-app`
      spawns `pipes-settings` as a child process and exits, rather than
      reimplementing a config UI inside the `.scr` itself.
- [x] "Pipe behavior" drawer section exposes `straight_weight`/
      `turn_weight` ratio and `elbow_probability` sliders (validated as
      wanted — `pipes.sh -s` — per `docs/FEATURE_IDEAS.md`), plus the
      teapot easter egg toggle/probability.

## Phase 3 — Native screensaver wrappers

Status differs sharply by platform, honestly: only Windows was buildable
*and* testable on the machine this was developed on. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#native-screensaver-wrappers-phase-3)
for the full writeup per platform.

### Windows — done, tested

- [x] `/s`, `/c`, `/p <HWND>` contract parsed (`screensaver_args.rs`,
      unit-tested) and acted on in `pipes-app::main`.
- [x] `/s`: real borderless fullscreen, cursor hidden, exits on any
      keypress/click/mouse-movement (after a 750ms startup grace period —
      see ARCHITECTURE.md for the exact bug this fixed).
- [x] `/c`: spawns `pipes-settings` next to the running executable, exits.
- [x] `/p <hwnd>`: reparents our window into the given HWND via Win32
      `SetParent`/`SetWindowLongPtrW`/`SetWindowPos` (`winsaver.rs`).
- [x] Smoke-tested locally, end to end: `/c` launches `pipes-settings` and
      exits; `/p <hwnd>` embeds live into a real test window (screenshot-
      verified); `/s` goes fullscreen and exits correctly on input after
      the grace period; the built `.exe` renamed to `.scr` behaves
      identically to the `.exe` when invoked the way Windows itself would
      (`CreateProcess`, not a shell's file-association-aware launch).
- [ ] Not yet done: no live resize handling for the `/p` preview thumbnail
      (assumed fixed-size for the dialog's lifetime — untested whether
      that assumption holds on every Windows version); no `.msi`
      installer yet (Phase 4).

### Linux — real rendering code, real packages, verified on hardware

- [x] `pipes-xscreensaver` crate: resolves its target window from both
      channels the real contract uses — `-root` / `-window-id <id>`
      (decimal or hex) on the command line, *and* the
      `XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW` environment variable the daemon actually uses
      — unit-tested, with argv given precedence over the environment.
- [x] `pipes_render::Renderer::new` generalized from a concrete
      `Arc<winit::window::Window>` parameter to generic over anything
      implementing the raw-window-handle traits `wgpu` needs — so this
      one shared renderer works for a real winit window (`pipes-app`/
      `pipes-settings`) *and* a raw X11 window this crate doesn't own.
- [x] `x11_target.rs`: opens the X display via `x11-dl` (dynamic `dlopen`
      at runtime, not link-time linking — this is why it costs nothing to
      compile on Windows/macOS CI too), resolves the root window or a
      specific `-window-id`, selects for `StructureNotifyMask` so resizes
      are actually observed, and implements `HasWindowHandle`/
      `HasDisplayHandle` by hand for the `RawWindowHandle::Xlib`/
      `RawDisplayHandle::Xlib` variants.
- [x] `main.rs`'s Linux branch runs a real render loop: steps the
      `Scene` on the configured tick interval, polls for X11
      `ConfigureNotify` events each frame to call `renderer.resize`, and
      calls `renderer.render` — the same `pipes-core`/`pipes-render`
      pipeline `pipes-app` uses on Windows, not a reimplementation.
- [x] Verified by actually compiling and clippy-checking (`-D warnings`)
      against `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` from this project's Windows
      machine — not guessed API usage: every `x11-dl`/`raw-window-handle`
      call was checked against the real fetched crate source first (exact
      field names, function signatures, the `XEvent` union's `get_type()`
      helper, etc.).
- [x] **Verified on real Linux hardware** — the gap this section used to
      call its single biggest unverified assumption is closed. A GPU
      surface does come up correctly: the workspace builds clean on
      Linux, all tests pass, and `pipes-xscreensaver` was watched
      rendering both into the root window of a bare X server and into the
      window a live `xscreensaver` 6.08 daemon handed it, on an NVIDIA
      RTX 3060 Ti through wgpu's Vulkan backend.
- [x] The exact xscreensaver hack CLI contract, checked against a live
      `xscreensaver` 6.08 install — and the best-guess version had a real
      hole in it. `-root`/`-window-id <id>` are accepted by stock hacks
      and are what `xscreensaver-settings` uses to drive its preview, so
      that much was right. **But the daemon passes no arguments at all**:
      its driver (`xscreensaver-gfx`) hands a hack its window purely
      through the `XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW` environment variable, formatted
      `0x%lX`. Confirmed by running a probe script as a configured hack
      under a real daemon — argv came through empty with
      `XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW=0x60000C` set — and corroborated by `strings`
      on `xscreensaver-gfx` and the stock hacks. Reading argv alone meant
      falling back to the root window and drawing *behind* xscreensaver's
      saver window, i.e. a black screen; `args::resolve_target_window`
      now reads both channels.

### macOS — runs from source, no `.saver` code yet

- [x] Confirmed by the first real CI run: the existing workspace (`pipes-core`,
      `pipes-render`, `pipes-app`, `pipes-settings`, `pipes-xscreensaver` —
      everything that exists so far) builds and passes its tests on
      `macos-latest` in 1m29s. Useful, but not the same thing as a `.saver`
      — no `ScreenSaverView`/bundle code exists yet.
- [x] Pilot-tested on a real Mac (Apple Silicon, A18 Pro, macOS 26.4.1,
      wgpu Metal backend): the workspace builds, the full test suite
      passes, and both GUI binaries launch and render. Four macOS
      problems turned up, all fixed and re-verified on the same machine
      by launching and screenshotting:
  - [x] **`/s` wasn't fullscreen.** `Fullscreen::Borderless` is the
        native Spaces transition on macOS, and the unbundled binary
        opened as a titled window with the menu bar and Dock showing.
        `/s` now uses winit's macOS simple fullscreen
        (`build_window`): edge to edge, menu bar and Dock hidden.
  - [x] **`/s` sometimes quit on its own** about 0.8s after launch, just
        past the 750ms input grace period, with nobody touching the
        machine (3 of 15 hands-off runs before; 0 of 20 after). The
        trigger was the old fullscreen transition: a hands-off A/B with
        only the fullscreen change (old cursor logic) also survived 10
        of 10. As defense in depth, a `CursorMoved` now only counts once
        the cursor has really traveled (`cursor_exit.rs`, unit-tested);
        a real mouse move, a keypress and a click still exit, and a
        3-point jiggle doesn't — all checked with synthetic input.
  - [x] **Pipes Settings offered Mac users the Windows `.msi` update.**
        The update check is now skipped outside Windows (it can only
        install the `.msi`), so no banner or toast appears there. This
        fixes the same latent bug on Linux, though that part was only
        reasoned from the code, not run on Linux.
  - [x] **Debug builds panicked listing displays** (`icrate 0.0.4`'s
        `NSFastEnumeration` encoding vs. current macOS, checked only
        with debug assertions). Fixed with debug-assertion overrides for
        just `objc2` and `icrate` in the workspace `Cargo.toml`;
        `cargo run -p pipes-app` works on macOS. Remove after moving
        past winit 0.29.
- [ ] Not started. A `.saver` is an `NSBundle` implementing
      `ScreenSaverView` (`objc2` + `objc2-screen-saver`), built as a
      `cdylib` with `-bundle` and an `Info.plist` — normally an Xcode-
      toolchain job, not plain `cargo build`. No code was written here
      yet. A Mac is now available to verify it on, so it's unblocked.

### Cross-platform

- [x] CI now builds and tests the whole workspace on all three OSes on
      every push — see the Phase 1 checkbox above for the first run's
      results.
- [ ] Each wrapper gets its own smoke test appropriate to its platform —
      done for Windows (see above); Linux has now had a real manual
      display-server smoke test (bare X server *and* a live `xscreensaver`
      daemon, rendering confirmed by screenshot — see the Linux section
      above), though it isn't automated in CI yet, since a GPU-backed X
      server isn't something the stock `ubuntu-latest` runner provides;
      macOS has been smoke-tested by hand on a real Mac (see the macOS
      section above), but the `.saver` code doesn't exist yet and
      `scripts/verify.sh` doesn't run on macOS.
- [x] Multi-monitor behavior — three modes, a Pipes Settings toggle:
      `MonitorMode::AllMonitors` (default, independent per-display
      instances, each with a distinct-but-deterministic seed via
      `seed_for_monitor`), `MonitorMode::Span` (one shared scene rendered
      via an off-axis per-monitor tile projection, so pipes visually travel
      from one display onto the next — see
      `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#multi-monitor-behavior` for the technique), and
      `MonitorMode::PrimaryOnly` (the old single-display-only behavior).
      `pipes-app`'s `/s` mode enumerates `winit`'s `available_monitors()`
      and builds one window + renderer per display accordingly.
      Cross-platform in principle (the code is behind no `cfg(windows)`),
      but only physically verified on this project's single-monitor dev
      machine so far — the tile-projection math itself is precisely
      unit-tested (a full-canvas tile is numerically identical to the
      ordinary symmetric projection; adjacent tiles are asserted to share
      matching frustum boundaries), but the actual N>1-displays seam has
      not been watched on real hardware.

## Phase 4 — Installable packages

### Windows — done

- [x] `neo_win_pipes.msi` (`installer/main.wxs`, built with WiX Toolset
      v7 — not `cargo-wix`, which targets the older WiX v3 that needs an
      admin-only Windows Feature; WiX v7 installs per-user as a `dotnet`
      tool instead). One double-click installs both `pipes-settings.exe`
      (Program Files + Start Menu shortcut, like a normal app) and
      `pipes-app.exe` (renamed `neo_win_pipes.scr`, into `System32` — the
      OS's own convention for where the screensaver dropdown looks).
- [x] Deliberately does **not** auto-select itself as the active
      screensaver or touch `HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop` — installing only
      makes it available in the dropdown, the same restraint any
      well-behaved installer should have toward existing user settings.
- [x] Validated without needing an actual elevated install (which would
      need an interactive UAC click, not automatable): `wix msi validate`
      (clean ICE pass, one expected/benign ICE09 warning about the
      System32 file being non-permanent — correct, since we want it
      removed on uninstall) and an administrative extract
      (`msiexec /a ... TARGETDIR=...`) confirming the exact file layout.
      The final elevated install itself still needs a human click-through
      — see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md#building-the-windows-installer-msi).
- [x] `pipes-app`'s `/c` handler updated (`settings_app_candidates()`) to
      find `pipes-settings.exe` in its installed Program Files location,
      not just next to the running exe — needed since the `.scr` and the
      settings app now live in different directories once installed.
- [x] A discoverable "Uninstall neo_win_pipes" Start Menu shortcut
      (`msiexec /x [ProductCode]`) alongside "Pipes Settings" — on top of
      the automatic Programs & Features listing every MSI gets for free.
- [x] Auto-update: `pipes-settings` checks GitHub Releases in the
      background and offers a one-click "Update Now" when a newer `.msi`
      is published — see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#auto-update-pipes-settingsupdate)
      for the full design and why a fully silent updater isn't realistic
      given the `System32` requirement (still one UAC prompt per update).
      Free: no paid update host, no background service — just GitHub's
      own Releases API.
- [x] The downloaded `.msi` is verified against GitHub's own SHA-256
      digest for that release asset before `msiexec` ever runs it
      (`update::verify_checksum`) — catches a corrupted download or
      tampering in transit/at rest, using a value already fetched for
      free. Not a substitute for code signing (still unsigned, see
      below) and can't vouch for the release itself being legitimate,
      only that the bytes on disk match what GitHub says it served. See
      `SECURITY.md`.
- [x] **Native OS toast for the update banner** (`crates/pipes-settings/src/notify.rs`)
      — fires a real Windows toast notification (not just the in-app
      banner) the first time an update check finds a newer version;
      clicking it focuses the already-running Pipes Settings window.
      Deliberately *not* a background/tray app that checks while the app
      is closed — see `docs/FEATURE_IDEAS.md`'s "My own assessment"
      section for why that would reverse this project's own
      no-background-service design choice for very little real benefit.
      Windows-only for now (macOS/Linux equivalents would be genuinely
      untested platform code, which `CLAUDE.md`'s conventions rule out).
      The toast itself was confirmed showing correctly on a real install,
      but **clicking it did nothing** — a real bug reported by an actual
      user, not caught earlier since nothing here could watch a toast
      render or be clicked until a human actually did. Root cause: the
      `ToastNotification` object was a local variable dropped the instant
      `notify_update_available` returned, and a toast's `Activated`
      (click) event only has something to fire on for as long as that
      object is still alive. Fixed by returning it (`ToastHandle`) and
      having `main.rs` hold it in a variable scoped to the whole event
      loop instead. Not yet re-confirmed against a real install (needs
      the next release + a human to click it again) — flagging that
      honestly rather than claiming it's fully verified twice over.
- [x] `.github/workflows/release.yml`: pushing a `v*.*.*` tag now builds
      and publishes the `.msi` to a GitHub Release automatically — the
      "supply side" the updater above depends on. One version number
      (the git tag) flows into `Cargo.toml`, the compiled binaries'
      `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`, and the installer's `ProductVersion`, so
      there's nothing to keep in sync by hand across three places.
- [ ] Not yet done: code signing (currently unsigned — Windows SmartScreen
      will warn on first run/update until there's a code-signing
      certificate, which costs money — deliberately out of scope for a
      free hobby project unless that changes).
- [x] Custom installer artwork (welcome/EULA background + progress banner
      cropped from the same pipes hero screenshot the splash site uses,
      regenerated via `installer/make_installer_bmps.ps1`; the banner
      carries a "neo_win_pipes" wordmark rendered in the site's own
      DotGothic16 font, baked into the bitmap since MSI's native dialog
      text can only use fonts already on the target machine), a Desktop
      shortcut alongside the Start Menu one, and filled-out ARP metadata
      (`ARPHELPLINK`/`ARPURLINFOABOUT`/`ARPCOMMENTS` + `SummaryInformation`)
      for the Programs and Features listing and the `.msi`'s own file
      properties. Deliberately not doing: letting the user choose an
      install location (would break `/c`'s fixed Program-Files lookup for
      `pipes-settings.exe`) or code signing (costs money, see the
      known-limitation below).
- [x] Persistent file logging + a human-readable fatal-error dialog.
      Prompted by the `windows_subsystem` fix above: a release build has
      no console, so `stdout` (where logs used to go) now goes nowhere —
      without this, a real failure would be completely invisible instead
      of just hard to see. `pipes_render::diagnostics` (shared by both
      binaries) now writes a daily-rotating log file alongside the config
      file, and installs a panic hook that shows a native `MessageBoxW`
      dialog with a plain-English summary before the process exits. See
      `docs/LOGGING.md`.

#### Known issues (found testing the real v0.2.0 install — fixed in v0.2.1)

- [x] Clicking "Settings" from the Windows screensaver dialog didn't open
      Pipes Settings after a real install. Real root cause (confirmed by
      actually building and validating the MSI locally, not just reading
      code): `.github/workflows/release.yml`'s `wix build` never passed
      `-arch x64`, so WiX v7 defaulted to x86 and resolved
      `ProgramFilesFolder` to `Program Files (x86)` — but `cargo build
      --release` on the runner produces native 64-bit binaries, and a
      native 64-bit `pipes-app.exe`'s `%ProgramFiles%` resolves to plain
      `Program Files`. The two disagreed, so `settings_app_candidates()`
      never found the real (x86-installed) `pipes-settings.exe`. Fixed:
      `wix build` now passes `-arch x64`; `installer/main.wxs`'s
      `StandardDirectory` refs switched to `ProgramFiles64Folder` /
      `System64Folder` (required once components are 64-bit — caught by
      `wix msi validate`'s ICE80 check, again only by actually running it).
      `settings_app_candidates()` in `crates/pipes-app/src/main.rs` also
      hardened to check `ProgramFiles`, `ProgramW6432`, and
      `ProgramFiles(x86)`, so a future build/installer arch mismatch
      degrades to a redundant lookup instead of silent failure.
- [x] Dissolve and teapot settings didn't show up when Pipes Settings was
      opened normally. Not actually missing from the code — `ui.rs`'s
      `egui::SidePanel` had no `ScrollArea`, and the window is a fixed
      1200×760 (`main.rs`), so newly-added sections were pushed below the
      visible area with no way to scroll to them. Fixed: the drawer's
      contents are now wrapped in `egui::ScrollArea::vertical()`.
- [x] A console window (the tracing log output, green/yellow text) popped
      up whenever Pipes Settings launched, came to the front, and closing
      it killed the whole app — because closing a console window sends
      its default control handler a close event that terminates the
      attached process. Root cause: neither `pipes-app` nor
      `pipes-settings` set `#![windows_subsystem = "windows"]`, so both
      defaulted to the console subsystem on Windows. Fixed:
      `#![cfg_attr(not(debug_assertions), windows_subsystem = "windows")]`
      in both crates' `main.rs` — keeps the console for `cargo run` dev
      builds, drops it from the shipped release build. Verified by
      inspecting the built `.exe`'s PE header directly (`file` reports
      "console" for debug builds, "GUI" for release), not just by reading
      the attribute.
- [x] No app icon. Fixed: a "classic chrome elbow" design (a stylized
      pipe corner, chosen from three concepts after checking legibility
      down to 16px — a busier tri-color concept looked great at 256px but
      turned into an illegible blob at taskbar size) lives at
      `assets/icon/` as a 1024px master plus generated `windows/icon.ico`
      (multi-resolution), `macos/icon.icns`, and a Linux `hicolor` PNG
      theme set + scalable SVG. Wired into the actual build via `build.rs`
      + the `winres` crate in both `pipes-app` and `pipes-settings`
      (Windows-only, gated via `[target.'cfg(windows)'.build-dependencies]`
      so it doesn't affect macOS/Linux builds) — confirmed embedded by
      extracting the icon back out of the compiled `.exe`, not just by
      reading the build script. `installer/main.wxs` also references it
      for `ARPPRODUCTICON` (Programs and Features listing) and both Start
      Menu shortcuts.

### Linux — done, compiles/lints clean on real CI, runtime-verified

- [x] `installer/linux/build-deb.sh` builds a real `.deb`:
      `pipes-xscreensaver` into `/usr/libexec/xscreensaver/`, its
      xscreensaver config XML into `/usr/share/xscreensaver/config/`,
      `pipes-settings` into `/usr/bin/`, a `.desktop` launcher entry, and
      the existing `assets/icon/linux/` hicolor set + scalable SVG into
      `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/` (with `postinst`/`postrm` icon-cache and
      desktop-database refresh, `|| true` since those helper tools are
      themselves optional). Package `Depends` on `xscreensaver`,
      `libx11-6`, `libvulkan1`, `libwayland-client0`, `libxkbcommon0`.
- [x] `installer/linux/build-appimage.sh` builds a `pipes-settings`-only
      AppImage — deliberately **not** the hack too: an AppImage is an
      isolated, non-installed bundle by design, and `xscreensaver`'s
      driver discovers hacks by finding real files in real system
      locations, so a portable bundle structurally cannot deliver "install
      this as my screensaver" no matter how it's built. Same shape of
      limitation as a portable `.zip` not being able to register itself in
      Windows' Screen Saver dropdown without a real installer.
- [x] `.github/workflows/release.yml`'s `linux-packages` job builds both
      on real `ubuntu-latest` (own version-patch step, own
      `cargo build --release`, both packages, uploaded as an artifact),
      alongside the existing `windows-installer` job; a new
      `publish-release` job (`needs: [windows-installer, linux-packages]`)
      downloads both artifacts and publishes one GitHub Release with
      everything attached — avoids two jobs racing to create/update the
      same tagged release concurrently.
- [ ] Same runtime-verification gap as Phase 3 above: the `.deb`/AppImage
      themselves are built and validated for real in CI (`dpkg-deb --info`/
      `--contents`), but nobody has installed either on a real machine and
      watched `xscreensaver-demo` actually list/run "Neo Pipes", or run the
      AppImage and watched a window render.

### macOS — not started

- [ ] Signed `.pkg`/`.dmg` installing the `.saver` bundle (unsigned/
      ad-hoc-signed builds until there's an Apple Developer ID) — blocked
      on the `.saver` itself not existing yet (Phase 3). Distributing
      outside the Mac App Store without Gatekeeper warnings needs an
      Apple Developer Program membership for Developer ID signing and
      notarization.

## Explicitly out of scope for now

- Non-Rust language bindings.
- Mobile/tablet screensaver equivalents.

Revisit this list if a phase reveals it was wrong — this is a plan, not a
contract.

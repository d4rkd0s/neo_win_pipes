## System requirements

This project is deliberately lightweight — a handful of procedural meshes
and simple instanced draw calls, not a demanding renderer — so
requirements are modest. As a rough guide based on real measurements (see
below), rather than a broad hardware survey:

- **GPU**: anything with Vulkan, DirectX 12, or Metal support from
  roughly the last decade, integrated graphics included. On the modest
  end of what this project has actually tested — a Qualcomm Adreno X1-85
  (an ARM64 laptop's integrated GPU, Vulkan backend) — the shipped
  defaults render at ~350 FPS, and a deliberately heavy stress scene (a
  64³ grid, 150 pipes at once) still holds ~157 FPS. A dedicated/discrete
  GPU only matters if you turn the grid size and pipe count up well past
  the defaults.
- **CPU**: any CPU from the last decade. The simulation logic itself is
  the cheap part by a wide margin — `cargo bench -p pipes-core` puts a
  single tick at single-digit microseconds even on a large 64³-grid,
  200-pipe scene (see `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`).
- **OS**: Windows 10/11 (x64 or ARM64) or a Linux desktop running
  `xscreensaver` (X11). macOS (Apple Silicon verified) runs from source
  but isn't installable as a screensaver yet — see [macOS](#macos).

**Don't take these numbers as gospel for your own machine** — GPUs vary
enormously, and this project has only actually measured a small number of
them. Pipes Settings has a "Run Benchmark" button (under Performance in
the settings drawer) that runs the exact same three stages on your own
real hardware and lets you export the result as text or PDF, which is a
much more useful answer to "will this run well for me?" than any number
in this doc.

## Running the screensaver (dev/manual testing)

```sh
cargo run -p pipes-app -- --seed 1
```

A window opens and pipes start growing immediately — since no
screensaver flag was recognized, this behaves like `/s` (see below). If
more than one display is connected, one independent fullscreen instance
opens per display by default (see "Multi-monitor" below) — press
**Escape**, click, move the mouse, or close any window to quit all of
them (there's a short grace period right after startup so opening the
window itself doesn't immediately count as input).

### Options

| Flag     | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `--seed` | `1`     | RNG seed. Same seed always reproduces the exact same run — see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#pipes-core) on determinism. |

### Multi-monitor

With more than one display connected, `/s` mode spawns one independent
screensaver instance per display by default — each with its own random
scene, not a mirror of the others. Pipes Settings has a "Multi-monitor"
toggle with three options:

- **Independent per display** (default) — each screen its own scene, as above.
- **One big screen** — a single scene shared across every display, with
  pipes visually traveling from one monitor onto the next instead of each
  screen showing something unrelated. Works best with matching-resolution
  displays arranged in your OS's display settings to match how they
  actually sit on your desk.
- **Primary display only** — just one screen renders; others are left
  showing whatever was already on them.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#multi-monitor-behavior) for how
these were decided and how "one big screen" actually works under the
hood.

## Testing the Windows screensaver contract directly

`pipes-app` understands the same command-line contract Windows itself
uses to drive a `.scr` — see
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#native-screensaver-wrappers-phase-3)
for the full writeup. You can exercise each mode manually:

```sh
cargo run -p pipes-app -- /s              # fullscreen, exits on any input
cargo run -p pipes-app -- /c              # launches pipes-settings, exits
cargo run -p pipes-app -- /p 123456       # embeds into HWND 123456 (from another app)
```

## Installing it as your actual Windows screensaver

Download `neo_win_pipes.msi` from the
[latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/brando5393/neo_win_pipes/releases/latest),
or build it yourself — see
[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md#building-the-windows-installer-msi) for
how. Then just run it:

1. Double-click `neo_win_pipes.msi`. Windows will prompt for
   administrator approval (UAC) — installing to `System32` is genuinely a
   system-wide change, so this prompt is expected and correct, not a bug.
2. Click through the installer (Welcome → license → Install → Finish).
   That's it — no manual file copying, no finding `System32` yourself.
3. Open *Settings → Personalization → Lock screen → Screen saver*, pick
   "neo_win_pipes" from the dropdown. The installer does **not** select it
   for you automatically — it only makes it available, the same as
   installing any other screensaver, so it never silently overrides
   whatever you had configured before.
4. A **Pipes Settings** shortcut is added to the Start Menu too, so you
   can open the live-preview settings drawer any time, independent of the
   screensaver being active — the same app the `/c` config button opens.
5. Uninstall from *Settings → Apps* like any other program — this cleanly
   removes both the `.scr` from `System32` and the settings app.

### Environment variables

| Variable   | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `RUST_LOG` | Log verbosity/filter, e.g. `RUST_LOG=debug`. See [LOGGING.md](LOGGING.md). |

### If something goes wrong

A release build has no console window, so there's nothing to watch live
— but every run still writes a plain-text log file under
`%APPDATA%\neo-win-pipes\neo_win_pipes\data\logs\` (one file per binary
per day), and an unhandled crash shows a dialog pointing at that same
file with the technical detail included, so you don't have to go find it
yourself. See [LOGGING.md](LOGGING.md) for the full story.

## Running the settings app

```sh
cargo run -p pipes-settings
```

Opens "Pipes Settings": a live 3D preview on the left, a settings drawer
on the right (pipe style & count, speed & camera, multi-monitor behavior,
color palette, grid size & reset threshold). Every change applies to the live preview immediately
and autosaves to the shared config file shown at the bottom of the drawer
— the next time you run `pipes-app`, it picks up the same settings. Click
**Reset to defaults** to discard all customization.

The config file lives at the OS's standard per-user config location (e.g.
`%APPDATA%\neo_win_pipes\config.toml` on Windows) — see
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#pipes-render) for the full `AppConfig`
shape if you want to hand-edit it (it's validated/clamped on load either
way, so a bad edit can't break the app).

### Reporting a bug or requesting a feature

Click **Report Issue / Feedback…** in the drawer to open a small popup:
pick a category (Bug/Feature request/Question), fill in a title and
description, and — for Bug — optionally include recent log output (your
home directory path is redacted first, best-effort). Submitting opens a
pre-filled GitHub issue in your browser with the category already
applied as a label; you still need a GitHub account to actually submit
it there. Nothing is sent anywhere until you click "Submit new issue" on
that page.

### Update notifications

Pipes Settings checks GitHub for a newer release in the background each
time you open it. If one's available, a banner appears at the top:
**Update Now** downloads and launches the new installer (one UAC prompt,
same as installing — that's a real Windows security boundary, not
something an update can skip), **Release notes** opens what changed in
your browser, and **Dismiss** hides the banner for this session only
(it'll check again next time you open the app). See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#auto-update-pipes-settingsupdate) for
why this is the free, no-service, one-click version of "automatic
updates" rather than a fully silent one.

### On Windows-on-ARM64

If `cargo run` fails to link, see the toolchain caveat in
[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) — dot-source `scripts/dev-shell.ps1` first.

## Linux

> **Status**: real rendering code and a real `.deb`/AppImage exist and
> build/lint clean on actual `ubuntu-latest` CI — but nobody has
> installed either on a real machine and watched it render. See
> [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md#phase-3--native-screensaver-wrappers) for the
> full honest breakdown of what's compiled-and-verified versus what's
> still unconfirmed.

Download `pipes-xscreensaver_<version>_amd64.deb` from the
[latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/brando5393/neo_win_pipes/releases/latest):

```sh
sudo apt install ./pipes-xscreensaver_<version>_amd64.deb
```

That installs the hack (into `/usr/libexec/xscreensaver/`, alongside its
config XML so `xscreensaver-demo` can find it) and `pipes-settings` (as a
regular app, with a Start-Menu-equivalent launcher entry). Then:

1. Open `xscreensaver-demo` (or your desktop environment's screen saver
   settings, if it wraps xscreensaver) and select **Neo Pipes** from the
   hack list — named that way, not "Pipes", since the real xscreensaver
   package already ships its own, different "Pipes" hack.
2. Open **Pipes Settings** from your application menu for the same live
   preview + settings drawer Windows has — same shared config file, same
   simulation/rendering code.
3. `sudo apt remove pipes-xscreensaver` to uninstall.

**Prefer a portable option, or not on a Debian-based distro?** Download
`PipesSettings-<version>-x86_64.AppImage`, `chmod +x` it, and run it — no
install, no root. This is `pipes-settings` only, not the screensaver hack
itself: an AppImage is an isolated bundle by design, and
`xscreensaver`'s driver discovers hacks by finding real files in real
system locations, which a portable bundle can't provide (the same reason
a portable `.zip` can't register itself in Windows' Screen Saver
dropdown without a real installer) — the `.deb` above is still the only
path to actually installing the screensaver.

### Testing the hack directly, without a full xscreensaver setup

```sh
pipes-xscreensaver -root       # draws on the root window
pipes-xscreensaver             # same thing (root is the default)
```

`-window-id <id>` (decimal or hex) is what `xscreensaver`'s driver
actually passes when running it for real — pass a specific X11 window ID
to test that path manually.

## macOS

Runs from source, but isn't installable as a system screensaver yet.
Verified on an Apple Silicon Mac (macOS 26, Metal backend):

```sh
cargo run -p pipes-app -- --seed 1   # fullscreen screensaver; any key, click or mouse move exits
cargo run -p pipes-settings          # live preview + settings drawer
cargo run -p pipes-app -- /c         # opens Pipes Settings, like the Windows config button
```

- `/s` covers the whole display in macOS "simple" fullscreen: the menu
  bar and Dock hide, and no new Space is created.
- Pipes Settings saves to
  `~/Library/Application Support/dev.neo-win-pipes.neo_win_pipes/config.toml`.
- There's no in-app update check on macOS. The updater only knows how to
  install the Windows `.msi`, so it's skipped entirely rather than
  offering a download that can't run.
- `/p <hwnd>` is Windows-only; on macOS it logs a warning and opens an
  ordinary window.

What's missing is the `.saver` bundle macOS loads into its own screen
saver host, which is what makes it selectable in *System Settings →
Screen Saver*. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md#macos--not-started).
